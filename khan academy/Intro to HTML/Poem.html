    <h1>Poem</h1>
    <p> If you always try your best <br>
Then you’ll never have to wonder<br>
About what you could have done<br>
If you’d summoned all your thunder.<br>
And if your best<br>
Was not as good<br>
As you hoped it would be,<br>
You still could say,<br>
“I gave today<br>
All that I had in me.”<br> </p>
